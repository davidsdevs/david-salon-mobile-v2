2. **üìß Email Notifications** - Email sent to stylist's registered email  
3. **üì¨ In-App Notifications** - Visible in the notifications screen

## Integrated Flows

### 1. New Appointment Created ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/services/mobileAppointmentService.ts`
**When:** Client books a new appointment
**Notifications Sent:**
- Push notification to stylist's device
- Email to stylist's email address
- In-app notification in stylist's notification feed

**Code Location:** Lines 52-79

### 2. Appointment Cancelled ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/services/appointmentService.ts`
**When:** Client cancels an appointment
**Notifications Sent:**
- Push notification to stylist's device
- Email to stylist's email address
- In-app notification in stylist's notification feed

**Code Location:** Lines 354-407

### 3. App Initialization ‚úÖ
**File:** `App.tsx`
**What:** Notification services are initialized when app starts
**Features:**
- Requests push notification permissions
- Sets up notification listeners
- Handles notification taps for navigation
- Clears badge count when app opens

**Code Location:** Lines 132-200

## How It Works

### When a Client Books an Appointment:

```typescript
// In BookingSummaryScreen.tsx
const appointmentId = await MobileAppointmentService.createAppointment(appointmentData);

// MobileAppointmentService automatically:
// 1. Creates appointment in Firebase
// 2. Fetches stylist info (email, name)
// 3. Sends push + email + in-app notifications to stylist
```

### When a Client Cancels an Appointment:

```typescript
// In AppointmentsScreen.tsx
await AppointmentService.cancelAppointment(selectedAppointment.id, 'Cancelled by client');

// AppointmentService automatically:
// 1. Updates appointment status to 'cancelled'
// 2. Fetches stylist info (email, name)
// 3. Sends push + email + in-app notifications to stylist
```

## Configuration Required

### EmailJS Setup (for email notifications)

1. **Create Account:**
   - Go to https://www.emailjs.com/
   - Sign up for free account

2. **Set Up Email Service:**
   - Add your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Get your Service ID

3. **Create Email Template:**
   - Create template with variables: `{{to_name}}`, `{{subject}}`, `{{message}}`
   - Get your Template ID

4. **Update Configuration:**
   - Open `src/services/emailNotificationService.ts`
   - Replace placeholders:
     ```typescript
     const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'your_service_id_here';
     const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = 'your_template_id_here';
     const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_public_key_here';
     ```

## Testing

### Test Push Notifications:

```typescript
import { PushNotificationService } from './src/services/pushNotificationService';

// Send test notification
await PushNotificationService.sendLocalNotification({
  title: 'Test Notification',
  body: 'This is a test from David Salon',
  data: { test: true },
});
```

### Test Email Notifications:

```typescript
import { EmailNotificationService } from './src/services/emailNotificationService';

// Send test email
await EmailNotificationService.sendEmail({
  to_email: 'your-email@example.com',
  to_name: 'Test User',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  message: 'This is a test email from David Salon',
});
```

### Test Full Flow:

1. **Book an appointment** as a client
2. **Check stylist receives:**
   - Push notification on device
   - Email in inbox
   - In-app notification

3. **Cancel the appointment** as a client
4. **Check stylist receives:**
   - Push notification about cancellation
   - Email about cancellation
   - In-app notification about cancellation

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Add Reschedule Notifications
Currently, reschedule notifications are not fully integrated. To add:

**File:** `src/services/appointmentService.ts`
**Function:** `rescheduleAppointment` (around line 414)

Add after updating the appointment:
```typescript
await StylistNotificationService.notifyOfReschedule({
  stylistId,
  stylistEmail,
  stylistName,
  clientName,
  oldDate,
  oldTime,
  newDate,
  newTime,
  serviceName,
});
```

### 2. Add Confirmation Notifications
When admin/stylist confirms an appointment:

```typescript
await StylistNotificationService.notifyOfConfirmation({
  stylistId,
  stylistEmail,
  stylistName,
  clientName,
  appointmentDate,
  appointmentTime,
  serviceName,
});
```

### 3. Add Appointment Reminders
Set up scheduled jobs to send reminders:
- 24 hours before appointment
- 1 hour before appointment

```typescript
await StylistNotificationService.sendAppointmentReminder({
  stylistId,
  stylistEmail,
  stylistName,
  clientName,
  appointmentDate,
  appointmentTime,
  serviceName,
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Push Notifications Not Working
- Check permissions are granted
- Verify app is built with EAS (not Expo Go)
- Check device notification settings

### Email Notifications Not Sending
- Verify EmailJS credentials are correct
- Check EmailJS dashboard for errors
- Ensure email service is active
- Check spam folder

### In-App Notifications Not Showing
- Verify Firebase is configured
- Check Firestore rules allow writes
- Ensure user ID is correct
