# Login Module Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of role-based authentication and navigation in the David's Salon mobile application. The system now supports users with multiple roles (client and stylist) and provides a role selection modal when needed.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Role Selection Modal Component
**File:** `src/components/RoleSelectionModal.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Displays a modal for users with multiple roles to choose between client and stylist access
- **Features:**
  - Responsive design for both mobile and web platforms
  - Clean UI with role icons and descriptions
  - Prevents modal dismissal until role is selected
  - Supports both client and stylist role options

**Key Props:**
- `visible: boolean` - Controls modal visibility
- `onSelectRole: (role: 'client' | 'stylist') => void` - Callback when role is selected
- `userRoles: string[]` - Array of available roles for the user

### 2. Updated Login Logic
**File:** `src/screens/shared/LoginPageScreen.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added role checking logic after successful login
- Integrated RoleSelectionModal component
- Added state management for role selection
- Updated both mobile and web layouts

**New State Variables:**
- `showRoleModal: boolean` - Controls role selection modal visibility
- `userRoles: string[]` - Stores user's available roles

**New Functions:**
- `checkUserRoles()` - Analyzes user roles and determines if modal should be shown
- `handleRoleSelection(selectedRole)` - Handles role selection and updates Redux state

**Role Logic:**
1. After successful login, check if user has `roles` array
2. Filter roles to only include 'client' and 'stylist'
3. If multiple valid roles exist → Show role selection modal
4. If single valid role exists → Navigate directly
5. If no valid roles → Show access denied message

### 3. Redux State Management
**File:** `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`

**New Action:**
- `setSelectedRole(role: 'client' | 'stylist')` - Updates user's selected role in Redux state

**State Updates:**
- Updates `user.selectedRole` with chosen role
- Updates `user.userType` for backward compatibility
- Triggers navigation re-evaluation in App.tsx

**File:** `src/hooks/redux.ts`

**New Hook Function:**
- `selectRole(role: 'client' | 'stylist')` - Dispatches role selection action

### 4. Navigation Logic Updates
**File:** `App.tsx`

**Enhanced Role Detection:**
1. **Priority 1:** Check for `selectedRole` (from role selection modal)
2. **Priority 2:** Check for `roles` array and handle multiple/single roles
3. **Priority 3:** Fallback to `userType` for backward compatibility

**Navigation Flow:**
- Single role users → Direct navigation to appropriate dashboard
- Multiple role users → Role selection modal → Navigation based on selection
- Invalid role users → Logout and redirect to login

### 5. User Data Structure
The system now supports the following user data structure:

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  roles?: string[];           // Array of user roles ['client', 'stylist']
  selectedRole?: string;     // Currently selected role from modal
  userType?: string;         // Backward compatibility field
  // ... other user fields
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Single Role Users
1. User logs in with credentials
2. System detects single valid role
3. User is automatically navigated to appropriate dashboard
4. No role selection required

### Multiple Role Users
1. User logs in with credentials
2. System detects multiple valid roles
3. Role selection modal appears
4. User selects desired role (client or stylist)
5. System updates Redux state with selected role
6. User is navigated to appropriate dashboard

### Invalid Role Users
1. User logs in with credentials
2. System detects no valid roles
3. Access denied message is displayed
4. User is logged out and redirected to login

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Role Validation
- Only 'client' and 'stylist' roles are considered valid
- System gracefully handles missing or malformed role data
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing userType field

### State Management
- Role selection is persisted in Redux state
- Navigation automatically updates when role changes
- Modal state is managed locally in LoginPageScreen

### Error Handling
- Invalid roles trigger automatic logout
- Missing role data falls back to userType
- Network errors during login are handled gracefully

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Single Role User
- User with roles: ['client']
- Expected: Direct navigation to client dashboard
- Modal should not appear

### Test Case 2: Multiple Role User
- User with roles: ['client', 'stylist']
- Expected: Role selection modal appears
- User can select either role and navigate accordingly

### Test Case 3: Invalid Role User
- User with roles: ['admin'] or no roles
- Expected: Access denied message and logout

### Test Case 4: Backward Compatibility
- User with only userType field (no roles array)
- Expected: Works with existing userType logic

### Test Case 5: Role Selection Modal Testing
- **Current Issue**: The test user `chicorlcruz@gmail.com` doesn't have roles array in Firestore
- **Solution**: Use the "Test Role Selection" button on the login screen
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to login screen
  2. Click the red "Test Role Selection" button
  3. Role selection modal should appear
  4. Select either "Client" or "Stylist"
  5. Verify navigation works correctly

### Adding Roles to Existing User
To add roles array to existing users in Firestore:

1. **Via Firebase Console**:
   ```javascript
   // Run this in Firebase Console > Firestore > Console
   db.collection('users').where('email', '==', 'chicorlcruz@gmail.com').get().then(snapshot => {
     snapshot.forEach(doc => {
       doc.ref.update({
         roles: ['client', 'stylist'],
         updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
       });
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Via Code** (requires proper permissions):
   ```typescript
   import { updateUserRoles } from './src/utils/updateUserRoles';
   await updateUserRoles('user-id', ['client', 'stylist']);
   ```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Role Persistence:** Remember user's last selected role across sessions
2. **Role Switching:** Allow users to switch roles without re-login
3. **Role Permissions:** Implement role-based feature access control
4. **Admin Roles:** Support for additional roles like 'admin' or 'manager'

### Configuration Options
1. **Default Role:** Set default role for multiple-role users
2. **Role Ordering:** Customize role display order in modal
3. **Role Descriptions:** Make role descriptions configurable

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/RoleSelectionModal.tsx` - **NEW FILE**
2. `src/screens/shared/LoginPageScreen.tsx` - **MODIFIED**
3. `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - **MODIFIED**
4. `src/hooks/redux.ts` - **MODIFIED**
5. `App.tsx` - **MODIFIED**

## Dependencies

- React Native Modal component
- Redux for state management
- Ionicons for role icons
- Existing authentication system (Firebase)

## 7. Comprehensive Logout System

### Complete Data Clearing

The logout system now includes comprehensive data clearing to ensure no user data remains in the app:

#### Files Updated:
- `src/screens/client/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Client profile logout
- `src/screens/stylist/StylistProfileScreen.tsx` - Stylist profile logout  
- `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - Redux logout action
- `src/utils/clearAllData.ts` - Utility function for data clearing

#### Data Cleared on Logout:
- **User Data**: name, email, roles array, selectedRole, userType
- **Authentication**: authToken, refreshToken, isAuthenticated state
- **App State**: branchId, membershipLevel, onboardingComplete
- **Navigation State**: isWaitingForRoleSelection, hasCheckedRoles, showRoleModal
- **All AsyncStorage**: Complete clearing of all stored data

#### Logout Process:
1. **User clicks logout** → Confirmation dialog appears
2. **Data clearing** → All AsyncStorage keys are removed
3. **Firebase signout** → Firebase authentication is cleared
4. **Redux reset** → All Redux state is reset to initial values
5. **Navigation** → User is redirected to login screen

#### Key Features:
- **Nuclear option**: Clears ALL AsyncStorage keys, not just known ones
- **Verification**: Logs remaining keys after clearing to ensure complete cleanup
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **User feedback**: Clear messaging about data clearing in confirmation dialog

## Conclusion

The role-based authentication system is now fully implemented with support for:
- Multiple role detection
- User-friendly role selection
- Automatic navigation based on role
- Backward compatibility with existing systems
- Responsive design for all platforms
- **Complete data clearing on logout**

The implementation provides a seamless user experience while maintaining system security and data integrity. The comprehensive logout system ensures complete data privacy and security.
