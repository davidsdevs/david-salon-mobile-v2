# Service History Screen Update

## Overview
The Clients screen has been transformed into a **Service History** screen that displays individual transaction records from the `transactions` collection.

## Data Source Change

### Before
- Fetched from: `appointments` collection
- Displayed: Aggregated client data (total visits, total spent per client)
- Grouped by: Client

### After
- Fetches from: **`transactions` collection**
- Displays: Individual service transactions
- Grouped by: Transaction (one row per service)

## Transaction Data Structure

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  name: string;              // Client name from clientInfo
  service: string;           // Service name from services array
  date: string;              // Transaction date (createdAt)
  type: 'X - New Client' | 'R - Regular' | 'TR - Transfer';
  amount: string;            // Service price
  paymentMethod: string;     // Payment method (cash, card, etc.)
  status: string;            // Transaction status (pending, completed, etc.)
  clientInfo: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
  };
}
```

## Firestore Query Logic

The screen now:
1. Listens to the `transactions` collection in real-time
2. Filters transactions where `services[].stylistId` matches the logged-in stylist
3. Creates one record per service in the transaction
4. Maps client type from `services[].clientType`:
   - `"X"` → `"X - New Client"`
   - `"R"` → `"R - Regular"`
   - `"TR"` → `"TR - Transfer"`

## Display Features

### Each Transaction Shows:
- **Client Name** - From `clientInfo.name`
- **Service Name** - From `services[].serviceName`
- **Client Type Badge** - From `services[].clientType`
- **Transaction Date** - From `createdAt` timestamp
- **Amount** - From `services[].price`

### Filtering Options:
- **All Types** - Shows all transactions
- **X - New Client** - First-time clients only
- **R - Regular** - Regular clients only
- **TR - Transfer** - Transferred clients only

### Search:
- Search by client name
- Search by service name

### Sorting:
- Automatically sorted by date (newest first)

## Example Transaction Data

```javascript
{
  branchId: "KYiL9JprSX3LBOYzrF6e",
  clientId: "1qOi4iF1YJOad3eEY7aiqZhxpYf1",
  clientInfo: {
    email: "overhealing123@gmail.com",
    name: "Gwyneth Cruz",
    phone: "09216845557"
  },
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  paymentMethod: "cash",
  services: [
    {
      clientType: "R",
      price: 200,
      serviceId: "service_beard",
      serviceName: "Beard Trim",
      stylistId: "4gf5AOdy4HffVillOmLu68ABgrb2",
      stylistName: "Claire Cruz"
    }
  ],
  status: "pending",
  total: 200
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Real Transaction History** - Shows actual completed transactions
2. **Service-Level Detail** - Each service is a separate record
3. **Accurate Client Types** - Uses the client type recorded at transaction time
4. **Better Performance** - Direct query on transactions instead of aggregating appointments
5. **Real-time Updates** - Automatically updates when new transactions are created
