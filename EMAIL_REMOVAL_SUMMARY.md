# Email Functionality Removed from Client-Side

## Changes Made

### File: `src/screens/client/BookingSummaryScreen.tsx`

#### 1. Removed Email Service Imports (Lines 21-26)
**Before:**
```typescript
import MobileAppointmentService, { AppointmentData } from '../../services/mobileAppointmentService';
// import EmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/emailService';
// import SMTPEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/smtpEmailService';
// import SendGridEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/sendGridEmailService';
// import BackendEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/backendEmailService';
import SimpleEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/simpleEmailService';
// import RealEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/realEmailService';
import { useAuth } from '../../hooks/redux';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import MobileAppointmentService, { AppointmentData } from '../../services/mobileAppointmentService';
import { useAuth } from '../../hooks/redux';
```

#### 2. Removed Email Sending Logic (Lines 300-328)
**Before:**
```typescript
// Create appointment
const appointmentId = await MobileAppointmentService.createAppointment(appointmentData);

// Prepare email data using normalized structure
const emailData: AppointmentEmailData = {
  clientName: appointmentData.clientName,
  clientEmail: appointmentData.clientEmail,
  appointmentDate: appointmentData.appointmentDate,
  appointmentTime: appointmentData.appointmentTime,
  branchName: state.bookingData.branchName || getBranchName(state.bookingData.branchId),
  services: appointmentData.serviceStylistPairs.map(pair => ({
    name: pair.serviceName,
    stylist: pair.stylistName,
    price: pair.servicePrice,
    duration: state.bookingData.selectedServices?.find(s => s.id === pair.serviceId)?.duration || 
             state.bookingData.serviceDuration || 0
  })),
  totalPrice: appointmentData.totalPrice,
  totalDuration: getTotalDuration(),
  ...(appointmentData.notes && { notes: appointmentData.notes }),
  appointmentId: appointmentId
};

// Send confirmation email
console.log('üìß Sending appointment confirmation email...');
const emailSent = await SimpleEmailService.sendAppointmentConfirmation(emailData);

if (emailSent) {
  console.log('‚úÖ Confirmation email sent successfully');
} else {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send confirmation email, but appointment was created');
}

Alert.alert(
  'Appointment Booked Successfully!',
  `Your appointment has been confirmed for ${state.bookingData.date} at ${state.bookingData.time}. ${emailSent ? 'A confirmation email has been sent to your Gmail inbox!' : 'Please check your email for confirmation details.'}`,
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Create appointment
const appointmentId = await MobileAppointmentService.createAppointment(appointmentData);

console.log('‚úÖ Appointment created successfully with ID:', appointmentId);

Alert.alert(
  'Appointment Booked Successfully!',
  `Your appointment has been confirmed for ${state.bookingData.date} at ${state.bookingData.time}.`,
```

## What Was Removed
- ‚ùå All email service imports (SimpleEmailService, RealEmailService, etc.)
- ‚ùå Email data preparation logic
- ‚ùå Email sending functionality
- ‚ùå Email confirmation messages in alerts

## What Was Kept
- ‚úÖ Appointment creation in Firebase
- ‚úÖ User email address display in UI
- ‚úÖ Success confirmation alert
- ‚úÖ Navigation back to dashboard after booking

## Current Behavior
1. User completes booking flow
2. Appointment is created in Firebase
3. Success alert is shown (without email confirmation message)
4. User is navigated back to dashboard
5. **No emails are sent**

## Benefits
- ‚úÖ No backend server required
- ‚úÖ Faster booking process
- ‚úÖ No email service dependencies
- ‚úÖ Simpler codebase
- ‚úÖ No network errors from email services

## If You Need Email Later
The email service files are still available in `src/services/`:
- `simpleEmailService.ts` - Console logging only
- `realEmailService.ts` - Requires Node.js backend
- `smtpEmailService.ts` - Direct SMTP
- `sendGridEmailService.ts` - SendGrid API
- `backendEmailService.ts` - Custom backend

You can re-enable email by:
1. Importing the desired email service
2. Adding back the email sending logic
3. Configuring the service credentials

## Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Email functionality successfully removed from client-side booking
