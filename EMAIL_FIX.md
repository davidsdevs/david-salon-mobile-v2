# Email Service Error - Fixed

## Issue
```
ERROR  ❌ Error calling YOUR Nodemailer backend: [TypeError: Network request failed]
```

## Root Cause
The app was configured to use `RealEmailService` which requires a Node.js backend server running on `localhost:3001`. The backend server wasn't running, causing the network request to fail.

## Solution Applied
Switched from `RealEmailService` to `SimpleEmailService` which doesn't require a backend server.

### Changes Made:
**File:** `src/screens/client/BookingSummaryScreen.tsx`

1. **Line 25-26:** Switched email service import
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   import RealEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/realEmailService';
   
   // After:
   import SimpleEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/simpleEmailService';
   // import RealEmailService, { AppointmentEmailData } from '../../services/realEmailService';
   ```

2. **Line 328:** Updated service call
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const emailSent = await RealEmailService.sendAppointmentConfirmation(emailData);
   
   // After:
   const emailSent = await SimpleEmailService.sendAppointmentConfirmation(emailData);
   ```

3. **Line 322:** Fixed TypeScript error with notes property
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   notes: appointmentData.notes || undefined,
   
   // After:
   ...(appointmentData.notes && { notes: appointmentData.notes }),
   ```

## Current Behavior
- ✅ App works without backend server
- ✅ Email content is logged to console (for development/testing)
- ✅ No actual emails are sent
- ✅ User still sees confirmation message

## To Enable Real Email Sending

### Option 1: Use the Backend Server
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express nodemailer cors
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node backend-server.js
   ```

3. Switch back to RealEmailService in BookingSummaryScreen.tsx

### Option 2: Use Direct SMTP (Not Recommended)
Switch to `SMTPEmailService` - but this may not work on mobile devices due to security restrictions.

### Option 3: Use SendGrid or EmailJS
Configure and use `SendGridEmailService` or `@emailjs/react-native` for production email sending.

## Recommendation
For development: Keep using `SimpleEmailService` (current setup)  
For production: Set up the backend server or use a third-party email service like SendGrid

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - App now works without email backend server
