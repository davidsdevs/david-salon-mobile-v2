# Navigation Fix Applied

## Issue
```
ERROR  The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"Root"} was not handled by any navigator.
Do you have a screen named 'Root'?
```

## Root Cause
In `BookingSummaryScreen.tsx`, after successfully booking an appointment, the app was trying to navigate to a screen named `'Root'` which doesn't exist in the navigation structure.

## Solution
Changed the navigation from:
```typescript
(navigation as any).navigate('Root');
```

To:
```typescript
navigation.reset({
  index: 0,
  routes: [{ name: 'Main' as never }],
});
```

## Why This Works
- The correct root screen name is `'Main'` (as defined in RootNavigator.tsx line 86)
- Using `navigation.reset()` properly resets the navigation stack to the main screen
- This ensures a clean navigation state after booking completion

## File Modified
- `src/screens/client/BookingSummaryScreen.tsx` (line 345)

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Navigation error resolved
