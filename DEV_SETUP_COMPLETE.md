# ‚úÖ Development Setup Complete

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Active Development

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Logger Utility Created
**File:** `src/utils/logger.ts`

**Purpose:** Automatically strips debug logs in production builds

**Usage in your code:**
```typescript
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';

// Instead of console.log
logger.log('User logged in');
logger.error('Something went wrong');
logger.firebase('Fetching appointments');
logger.api('POST', '/appointments', data);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Logs only show in development
- ‚úÖ Production builds are clean and fast
- ‚úÖ No need to manually remove logs later

---

### 2. ‚úÖ App Configuration Updated
**File:** `app.json`

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ iOS buildNumber: "1"
- ‚úÖ Android versionCode: 1
- ‚úÖ Permission descriptions (camera, photos, location)
- ‚úÖ Additional Android permissions
- ‚úÖ EAS project placeholder

**Why:** Required for production builds and store submissions

---

### 3. ‚úÖ EAS Build Configuration
**File:** `eas.json`

**Purpose:** Configure builds for App Store and Play Store

**Build profiles:**
- `development` - For testing with Expo Go
- `preview` - For internal testing (APK)
- `production` - For store submission

**How to use:**
```bash
# When you're ready to test production builds
eas build --platform android --profile preview
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

---

## üìã What You Can Do Now

### Continue Development
‚úÖ Keep building features as normal  
‚úÖ Use `logger.log()` instead of `console.log()` in new code  
‚úÖ Don't worry about production yet

### When Ready to Test Production Builds
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure project
eas build:configure

# Build for testing
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## üéØ Next Steps (When You're Ready)

### Phase 1: Continue Development (Now - Next 4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Build features
- [ ] Use logger utility for new code
- [ ] Test on Expo Go
- [ ] Deploy Firebase indexes when needed

### Phase 2: Pre-Launch Preparation (4-6 weeks before launch)
- [ ] Review `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- [ ] Create Privacy Policy
- [ ] Create Terms of Service
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Clean up remaining console.logs
- [ ] Test production builds

### Phase 3: Store Submission (2-3 weeks before launch)
- [ ] Create store assets (screenshots, descriptions)
- [ ] Submit to App Store
- [ ] Submit to Play Store
- [ ] Monitor review process

## üí° Tips for Development

### Use the Logger
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Auto-strips in production
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';
logger.log('Debug info');

// ‚ùå Avoid - Will show in production
console.log('Debug info');
```

### Test on Real Devices
```bash
# Scan QR code with Expo Go
expo start

# Or run on specific platform
expo start --android
expo start --ios
```

### Keep Dependencies Updated
```bash
# Check for updates
npm outdated

# Update when needed
npm update
```

## üöÄ You're All Set!

Your app is configured for:
- ‚úÖ Active development
- ‚úÖ Future production builds
- ‚úÖ App Store submission (when ready)

**Focus on building features now. Revisit the deployment checklist 4-6 weeks before launch.**
